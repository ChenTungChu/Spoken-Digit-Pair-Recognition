# Spoken-Digit-Pair-Recognition

This is an in-class Kaggle competition for building a classifier that recognizes two people are being spoken in an audio file for large data set.
In this competetion I have tested out Na√Øve Bayes,logistic regression, decisiontree,and support vector machine(SVM) as my classification method.
For better accuracy, I have implemented both network and two-dimensional CNN with MFCC features to train the classifier.
